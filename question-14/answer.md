Answer: ReactJS cebouse its simplicity, performance, and flexibility.

One of the main advantages of ReactJS is its component-based architecture. ReactJS allows developers to break down the user interface into small, reusable components, which can be easily composed together to build complex UIs. This makes it easy to manage the complexity of large applications and enables developers to reuse code across different parts of the application.

ReactJS also has a large and active community of developers, which has produced a wide range of tools, libraries, and resources to support development with ReactJS. This includes tools for state management, routing, testing, and more.

Another advantage of ReactJS is its performance. ReactJS uses a virtual DOM to optimize updates and minimize the number of changes that need to be made to the real DOM. This results in faster rendering and better performance compared to traditional DOM manipulation techniques.
