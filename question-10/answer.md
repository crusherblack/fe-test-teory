Vue's computed and watch are both reactive features that allow developers to respond to changes in data and update the UI accordingly. However, there are differences in how they work and when to use them.

Computed properties are functions that are used to compute a value based on other data properties. They are cached based on their dependencies and are only recomputed when their dependencies change. Computed properties are used to perform simple calculations or transformations on data properties and return the result. Computed properties are defined using the computed property in a Vue component. Here's an example:

```javascript
Copy
computed: {
  fullName() {
    return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
  }
}
```

In this example, fullName is a computed property that returns the full name by concatenating firstName and lastName. The computed property will only be recomputed when either firstName or lastName is updated.

Watchers, on the other hand, are functions that are used to respond to changes in data properties. They watch for changes in data properties and perform some action when the property changes. Watchers are defined using the watch property in a Vue component. Here's an example:

```javascript
watch: {
  firstName(newValue, oldValue) {
    console.log('firstName changed from', oldValue, 'to', newValue);
  }
}
```

In this example, a watcher is defined for the firstName property. When the value of firstName changes, thewatcher function will be called with the new and old values of the property as arguments. The watcher function can perform any action based on the change in the value of the property.

The main difference between computed properties and watchers is that computed properties are used to compute a value based on other properties, while watchers are used to perform an action based on a change in a property. Computed properties are useful for performing simple calculations or transformations on data properties, while watchers are useful for performing more complex actions such as making API calls or updating the UI based on a change in a property.

In summary, computed properties are used to compute a value based on other properties, while watchers are used to perform an action based on a change in a property. Computed properties are useful for performing simple calculations or transformations on data properties, while watchers are useful for performing more complex actions such as making API calls or updating the UI based on a change in a property.
